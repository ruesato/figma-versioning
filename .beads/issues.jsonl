Update Commit interface in types.ts: Add 'title' field (required), rename 'message' to 'description' (optional)\n2. Update ui.tsx form: Add separate title input field and description textarea (match Figma's layout from screenshot)\n3. Update main.ts CREATE_VERSION handler: Receive title and description separately\n4. Research Figma's saveVersionHistoryAsync API to determine if it accepts title and description separately\n5.
