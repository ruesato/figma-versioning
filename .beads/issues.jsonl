If previous entry has 0 comments/annotations, next entry includes ALL elements from beginning of file.\n\nRoot Cause: filterNewComments and filterNewAnnotations use fingerprint matching against previous commit elements. When previous commit is empty, ALL elements match as new.\n\nSolution: \n1. Comments: Use timestamp-based filtering (comment.created_at \u003e previousCommit.timestamp) - REST API provides created_at but NOT modified_at\n2. Annotations: Keep fingerprint-based filtering (no timestamps in Plugin API), add edge case handling for 0-entry commits\n3. Allow empty commits with correct filtering\n\nTechnical Approach:\n- Modify filterNewComments() to use timestamp comparison instead of fingerprints\n- For annotations: Keep fingerprints, add special handling when previous commit has empty array to prevent reappearing all historical annotations\n- May need to track global annotation fingerprints across all commits, or determine if 0-entry is first commit vs subsequent\n\nFiles to Modify:\n- packages/figma-plugin/src/main.ts - filterNewComments(), filterNewAnnotations() functions","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"ruesato@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-03T00:46:30.405289-10:00","created_by":"Ryan Uesato","updated_at":"2026-02-03T00:46:30.405289-10:00","comments":[{"id":1,"issue_id":"figma-versioning-d3w","author":"Ryan Uesato","text":"Implemented timestamp-based filtering for comments and all-history filtering for annotations.

Update Commit interface in types.ts: Add 'title' field (required), rename 'message' to 'description' (optional)\n2. Update ui.tsx form: Add separate title input field and description textarea (match Figma's layout from screenshot)\n3. Update main.ts CREATE_VERSION handler: Receive title and description separately\n4. Research Figma's saveVersionHistoryAsync API to determine if it accepts title and description separately\n5. Update changelog frame-builder.ts: Render title prominently and description below\n6. Add migration logic: Convert existing commits with only 'message' to have title='message' and description=''\n7. Update all TypeScript references from 'message' to 'title'/'description'\n\nBenefits:\n- Matches Figma's native UX\n- Better structure for future LLM integration\n- Clearer separation of commit summary vs details\n\nFiles to modify:\n- packages/core/src/types.ts (Commit interface)\n- packages/figma-plugin/src/ui.tsx (form UI)\n- packages/figma-plugin/src/main.ts (handler)\n- packages/figma-plugin/src/changelog/frame-builder.ts (rendering)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"ruesato@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T22:06:52.299217-10:00","created_by":"Ryan Uesato","updated_at":"2026-01-15T22:11:26.498927-10:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T22:11:26.498927-10:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

{"id":"figma-versioning-vnr","title":"Fix changelog diff inconsistencies - use timestamps instead of fingerprint matching","description":"## Problem\n\nChangelog entries show inconsistent diffs:\n\n1. If a previous changelog entry has 0 comments/annotations (no elements changed, but entry created anyway), the next entry includes ALL elements from the beginning of the file\n2. Current implementation uses fingerprint matching to filter elements, which doesn't handle this case correctly\n3. This behavior is confusing - elements reappear even though they haven't changed\n\n## Root Cause\n\n- filterNewComments() and filterNewAnnotations() use fingerprint matching against previous commit's elements\n- When previous commit has empty comments/annotations, ALL elements match as new\n- Comments have timestamps but we're not using them for filtering\n- Annotations don't have timestamps, so fingerprint is the only current option\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Comments: Use timestamp-based filtering\n   - Only include comments created AFTER previous commit timestamp\n   - Also handle edited comments (if Figma API provides modification time)\n   \n2. Annotations: Add timestamp to Annotation type\n   - Check if Figma Plugin API provides annotation modification timestamps\n   - If available, use timestamp-based filtering like comments\n   - If not available, keep fingerprint-based filtering but handle 0-entry case\n\n3. Empty commits: Allow but fix the diffing logic\n   - Continue allowing commits with 0 comments/annotations\n   - Fix filtering to handle case where previous commit had 0 elements\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n- Update filterNewComments() to use timestamp comparison instead of fingerprints\n- Check Figma API for node.annotations timestamp availability\n- If timestamps available for annotations, update Annotation type in packages/core/src/types.ts\n- If not available, add special handling for empty previous commit case in filterNewAnnotations()\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- packages/figma-plugin/src/main.ts - filterNewComments(), filterNewAnnotations() functions\n- packages/core/src/types.ts - Annotation interface (if adding timestamp)","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"ruesato@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-03T00:43:07.340351-10:00","created_by":"Ryan Uesato","updated_at":"2026-02-03T00:46:36.240364-10:00","close_reason":"Closed","deleted_at":"2026-02-03T00:46:36.240364-10:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}
