{"id":"figma-versioning-egc","title":"Comments not appearing in Figma canvas changelog","description":"New annotations are rendered in changelog entries on Figma canvas, but comments are not appearing. When inspecting the rendered changelog's layers, there is no Comments container nor any individual comment layers visible.\n\nComments are fetched from Figma API but are not being rendered in the createCommitEntryFrame function.","notes":"ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:\n\nThe issue was caused by clock skew between client time (new Date()) and Figma server time (comment created_at). The code was using timestamp-based filtering which failed when:\n- User creates Version A at client time 10:00:00\n- User creates comment at client time 10:00:05\n- Figma server saves comment with server timestamp 9:59:58 (2s behind)\n- User creates Version B\n- filterNewComments() filters out comment because 9:59:58 is NOT \u003e 10:00:00\n\nFIX IMPLEMENTED:\nRestored fingerprint-based deduplication (matching author|text|nodeId) instead of timestamp comparison. This approach:\n1. Avoids clock skew issues entirely\n2. Matches the proven approach used for annotations\n3. Was originally implemented in commit 5091517 but mistakenly reverted\n\nThe fix compares comment content (author|text|nodeId fingerprint) against ALL previous comments from ALL commits, ensuring duplicates are filtered out without timing issues.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"ruesato@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T15:24:23.082842-10:00","created_by":"Ryan Uesato","updated_at":"2026-02-06T22:40:54.777633-10:00","closed_at":"2026-02-06T22:40:54.777633-10:00","close_reason":"Fixed by restoring fingerprint-based comment deduplication.

{"id":"figma-versioning-vnr","title":"Fix changelog diff inconsistencies - use timestamps instead of fingerprint matching","description":"## Problem\n\nChangelog entries show inconsistent diffs:\n\n1. If a previous changelog entry has 0 comments/annotations (no elements changed, but entry created anyway), the next entry includes ALL elements from the beginning of the file\n2. Current implementation uses fingerprint matching to filter elements, which doesn't handle this case correctly\n3. This behavior is confusing - elements reappear even though they haven't changed\n\n## Root Cause\n\n- filterNewComments() and filterNewAnnotations() use fingerprint matching against previous commit's elements\n- When previous commit has empty comments/annotations, ALL elements match as new\n- Comments have timestamps but we're not using them for filtering\n- Annotations don't have timestamps, so fingerprint is the only current option\n\n## Solution\n\n1. Comments: Use timestamp-based filtering\n   - Only include comments created AFTER previous commit timestamp\n   - Also handle edited comments (if Figma API provides modification time)\n   \n2. Annotations: Add timestamp to Annotation type\n   - Check if Figma Plugin API provides annotation modification timestamps\n   - If available, use timestamp-based filtering like comments\n   - If not available, keep fingerprint-based filtering but handle 0-entry case\n\n3. Empty commits: Allow but fix the diffing logic\n   - Continue allowing commits with 0 comments/annotations\n   - Fix filtering to handle case where previous commit had 0 elements\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n- Update filterNewComments() to use timestamp comparison instead of fingerprints\n- Check Figma API for node.annotations timestamp availability\n- If timestamps available for annotations, update Annotation type in packages/core/src/types.ts\n- If not available, add special handling for empty previous commit case in filterNewAnnotations()\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- packages/figma-plugin/src/main.ts - filterNewComments(), filterNewAnnotations() functions\n- packages/core/src/types.ts - Annotation interface (if adding timestamp)","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"ruesato@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-03T00:43:07.340351-10:00","created_by":"Ryan Uesato","updated_at":"2026-02-03T00:46:36.240364-10:00","close_reason":"Closed","deleted_at":"2026-02-03T00:46:36.240364-10:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}
