# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

<!-- OPENSPEC:END -->

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, complete the following steps:

**WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **ASK BEFORE PUSHING** - Always ask the user before pushing to remote:
   - Ask: "Should I push these changes to the remote repository?"
   - If yes, run:
     ```bash
     git pull --rebase
     bd sync
     git push
     git status
     ```
   - If no, stop here and let the user push manually
5. **Clean up** (after push) - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** (after push) - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**IMPORTANT:**
- ALWAYS ask before pushing to remote - never push automatically
- If the user says no, stop and let them handle the push themselves
